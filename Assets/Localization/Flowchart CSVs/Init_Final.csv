SAY.Final.1.Ellie,,"Ahh, that was a little tiring. I wish I had more chances to eat the cherries."
SAY.Final.265.Miss,,Do you want the rest of them back? You can have them.
SAY.Final.267.Ellie,,"Noo! We went over this already! You take them. I have more at home! Plus, they were buy one pound get one pound free--"
SAY.Final.268.Ellie,,"Oh, wait, I shouldn’t have said that. Oops!"
SAY.Final.269.Miss,,"Hahaha! Don’t worry, it makes me feel a little better knowing you saved some money."
SAY.Final.264.Ellie,,"Mm, another day.{wc}...{wc}Miss told me to be there at 2 AM like usual, but I’m up early…{wc}I know it’s 11 PM right now, but I think I’ll just go now -- the address looked like it was way inside the forest. I’m bound to get lost.{wc}Ooh! Perhaps I should bring her some apples this time?"
SAY.Final.283.Ellie,,"{i}Somehow, I ended up navigating the directions perfectly well! That’s a win, but now I’m here 2 hours early.{wc}...{wc}After getting through an ivy-infested gate as tall as at least 200 crates of melons, I’m now standing in front of this huge manor clutching a basket of red apples in my hands.{wc}Well, red apples and a rose. Might as well have brought a slice of cake and a bottle of wine.{wc}..."
SAY.Final.81.Ellie,,"{i}Weird, I swear I just heard some sort of sound come from inside.{wc}...{wc}Okay, well, it wouldn’t be good if the crime scene was ruined, right?{wc}...But it’s kind of scary, and I don’t want to be that type of dumb horror movie protagonist...{wc}This wooden door in front of me is all that’s blocking me from the indoors and out.{wc}It’s actually quite pretty. The wood has little cedar patterns carved into it --{wi} maybe it’s made of cedar wood?—{wc}I’m jerked out of my thoughts as I hear another sound from inside.{wc}Should I just go inside?{wc}I really don’t want to disappoint Miss. I know she told me to wait until exactly 2 AM, but that was months ago, and aren’t we closer now?{wc}What if the scene gets ruined because I didn’t do anything about it?{wc}I could clean up the entire thing now and tell her I did it! I think she would be happy!{wc}My hands don’t reflect my thoughts, however, and they sweat so badly my basket feels like it just became a tug-of-war rope."
SAY.Final.83.Ellie,,{i}Whatever -- a leap of faith it is!{wc}For Miss!
SAY.Final.86.Ellie,,"{i}I walk into Spider Manor.{s=5}{wc}...{wc}{/s}{s=15}I freeze in shock. {wc}My basket drops to the floor. {wc}{/s}{s=20}The apples roll out one by one, encroaching the scene in front of me."
SAY.Final.289.Ellie,,Huh..??? Miss?
SAY.Final.299.,,"{i}I’m unable to say anything for a few moments.{wc}When I finally get my voice back, I can only stutter incoherent words, gesturing wildly between the person on the ground and Miss."
SAY.Final.300.Miss,,Ah.. Ellie?
SAY.Final.302.Miss,,...You’re here early.{wc}Or I guess you’re finally here on time?
SAY.Final.116.Ellie,,What... {wi}Are you okay? {wi}Did they -- {wi}why are you holding -- {wi}did you do this?{wc}No -- {wi}you can’t -- {wi}but -- {w=0.2}why? What-- {w=0.2}why would you do this? What did they do to you?
SAY.Final.92.Miss,,"I think you figured it out, so I’ll just answer your last question. What did this guy do to me?"
SAY.Final.134.Miss,,Nothing.
SAY.Final.132.Miss,,"But he trafficked humans and laundered money (remember the jewelry store?). Hundreds of people -- children, teens, adults, 6 year olds and 30 year olds -- all assaulted in unthinkable ways. And all for a perception of luxury."
SAY.Final.93.,,"{i}My legs give out, and I drop to my knees. I feel sick to my stomach.{wc}Thump, thump, thump... I can’t tell if it’s my heart or the apples rolling and colliding around me."
SAY.Final.96.Miss,,What’s wrong? {wi}Is it too disturbing?
SAY.Final.97.Ellie,,"{s=15}...Of course, you... {/s}{s=30}...psychopath!"
SAY.Final.98.,,{i}A beat of silence passes.
SAY.Final.99.Miss,,"Oh~, my Ellie, you’re so innocent~! {wi}I loved that about you, you know?{wc}I love your innocence, your naive little mind, so so much. And your reaction now -- to think I was scared of showing you! You don’t know how much better this makes me feel."
SAY.Final.139.Miss,,"Oh, the sickly sweet sight of a such a young and gullible person wandering the world on their own... the innocence one can never get back, the moment of love and loss..."
SAY.Final.142.Ellie,,"What... you... you’re sick...{wc}W-- wait... what do you mean “scared of corrupting me”?{wc}If this is what I was supposed to clean today, then have we been cleaning up after your crimes this entire time??"
SAY.Final.100.,,"{i}Miss opens her mouth to say something, but I cut her off."
SAY.Final.145.Ellie,,"The -- the jewelry replacements! Those were fake, weren’t they? And everything you had me do, just so people wouldn’t notice something went wrong.{wc}The ‘feud’ at the jewelry shop, that one clerk’s assurement that the jewelry was genuine, the atrocious 2 AM worktimes, the blood you convinced me wasn’t blood.{wc}It was all a lie...? {wi}These were all your own crimes?"
SAY.Final.102.Miss,,"You just noticed?{wc}Hahaha, you’re so cute. There’s more you haven’t observed yet.{wc}But yes, I guess some of what we’ve been covering have been ‘my’ crimes -- though they’re ours now, since you helped me cover them. Still valid crimes, if I do say so myself."
SAY.Final.103.Ellie,,"{s=15}...What do you mean, valid crimes?"
SAY.Final.104.Miss,,"Oh, darling, haven’t you ever wondered why these places you’ve been cleaning up are interconnected?{wc}Or maybe you didn’t realize."
SAY.Final.146.Miss,,"If only you did a little bit of research, though your naivety is one of your most charming points."
SAY.Final.105.Ellie,,"I... Don’t harm me, please. I’m going. I’m leaving. I’m quitting."
SAY.Final.106.Miss,,...And where would you go? At least we’re helping our world here.
SAY.Final.150.Miss,,"Oh, Ellie, wherever you go, there’s going to be terrible people, corrupt ones that would throw you away without a single thought.{wc}But I wouldn’t.{wc}And think about it. All we’re doing is cleaning the world, one mistake at a time."
SAY.Final.107.Ellie,,You mean one corpse at a time.
SAY.Final.108.Miss,,"Hahaha, sure, that works too.{wc}And yet we’re never going to run out of these corpses. In the end, the immoral acts of humanity will drown us all."
SAY.Final.109.Ellie,,"...No, you’re the one committing those immoral acts. A lot of people do good in this world without needing to resort to crime.{wc}We can fix everything without having to go through this."
SAY.Final.111.Miss,,Have you ever truly believed that whatever ‘good’ is defined as could outweigh human nature?
SAY.Final.112.Miss,,"Tell me you’ve never thought twice about being spit at for having this job, even though it’s really the backbone of society. "
SAY.Final.113.Miss,,"And look around you, at the people littering in the streets, blatantly lying to each others’ faces just to get a promotion, or cheating on their lover ‘just for a night.’ What’s there to love about people like that?"
SAY.Final.155.Miss,,"Sure, a single action might not define one’s entire being.{wc}But tell me you’ve never wished you could be someone else, to take their place in this universe -- or even just a single one of their possessions. {wi}Tell me you’ve never dreamed of being on top of the world, of being better than everyone else.{wc}Tell me you’ve lived your life without an inkling of selfishness or immorality.{wi} Because you cannot -- all of that is human nature.{wc}And we’re here doing this job, seeing this truth: for every mistake we clean up, infinitely more occur.{wc}People believe they can wash away their mistakes, but do you really think there’s anything left to clean up in this disaster of a world? We might as well say there’s no point to it all."
SAY.Final.157.Miss,,"Really, the phrase ‘cleaning up’ is all a beautiful lie. For as long as humanity remains corrupt, our work will never be done."
SAY.Final.161.Ellie,,"So why do you still do this? You know, if there’s ‘no point to it all’?"
SAY.Final.160.Miss,,"Well, the world might be doomed, but I’m trying to make it at least relatively livable for the next generation.{wc}I target people in power, Ellie. People who do these things for fun, just for a short adrenaline boost and a flow of bloody cash.{wc}You know what that motel was used for? Storing the trafficked victims.{wc}And you know who used to live in that abandoned underground building? {wi}Children who were sold and raped and whose innocence was forcibly seized when their day came.{wc}And the guy I just killed was the ringleader of it all. So I’m getting rid of corrupt people like that, one by one."
SAY.Final.159.Ellie,,But you said all people were corrupt. Not everyone's like that.
SAY.Final.163.Miss,,"We are, just to different degrees. And that includes you and I. Yet we’re still going to be the last ones here in a sea of chaos, cleaning up behind everyone else, for the future.{wc}There’s a sense of peace in staying back behind them all, in watching like we’re binging our favorite shows as they all take the same immoral paths and end up paying the price for it some way or another -- {wc}-- a price that sometimes we have to be the ones to dole out.{wc}But not everyone is in such a huge position of power, and some of us make better choices than others."
SAY.Final.164.Miss,,"In the end, it’s all about making life a little more tolerable for the next generation."
SAY.Final.166.Miss,,"Okay, no more fussing around now, I’d like to finish up so I can go back to sleep. Are you helping me clean today or not?"
MENU.Final.218,,I don't really want to.
MENU.Final.219,,...Let's partner up.
MENU.Final.238,,Do I even have a choice?
SAY.Final.169.Ellie,,"...No, I don’t really want to. Actually, I want to quit."
SAY.Final.176.Ellie,,"Humanity isn’t all that bad. And you’re... kind of creeping me out, Miss..."
SAY.Final.173.Miss,,"‘Humanity isn’t all that bad’? Think about yourself for a second, from the clothes you wear that were probably manufactured in a sweatshop to the way countless poor little animals went into making your cosmetics.{wc}Look at the accidents you see on the street, at the signs telling you not to feed animals or touch a relic yet people do so anyway.{wc}And I hate to bring this up, but if anything, global warming and the incompetence of humanity go hand in hand.{wc}So if you truly believe humanity ‘isn’t all that bad,’ then there wouldn't be so many unfixable problems in our world. But at the heart of it all, we’re just a corrupted species."
SAY.Final.174.Miss,,"That being said, you know you can’t escape, right? You’re a criminal. You helped cover up so many crimes--"
SAY.Final.170.Ellie,,I didn’t know it was illegal! I thought-- I thought-- it was just... being a cute girl dressing in a maid costume?{wi} That it was ... cool?
SAY.Final.179.Miss,,"Haha, I’ll never get over how cute you are.{wc}Ellie, you signed a contract when you first joined. Did you ever read it? You get to stay with me forever!"
SAY.Final.180.Ellie,,..I don’t want to. I can report you..!
SAY.Final.181.Miss,,And how would you do that?{wc}I have way more I can hold over your head than you mine. Ever wonder what’s under my mask?
SAY.Final.182.Ellie,,"...It doesn’t matter. I know your height, your name--"
SAY.Final.184.Miss,,"Sweetheart, I asked you to call me Miss for a reason. You don’t know my name."
SAY.Final.187.Ellie,,"...Your name isn't -- ?{wc}Ahh -- no, I don’t care.{wi}I don’t want to have anything to do with someone as messed up as you."
SAY.Final.186.Miss,,...Are you sure?
SAY.Final.297.Ellie,,"Yeah. Yeah, I don’t care what ‘corruption’ you say is in this world, I’m going to be a better person. You’re not the person I know."
SAY.Final.296.Miss,,You don't see it?
SAY.Final.185.Ellie,,See what?
SAY.Final.188.Miss,,"The corruption right in front of you, from your politicians to your police force to your insulin prices?"
SAY.Final.189.Ellie,,I don’t even take insulin! And those are all things we can fix!
SAY.Final.190.Miss,,"Do you want to leave, then? Go out that door and forever see the world with such a narrow mindset?"
SAY.Final.192.Miss,,"Haa.. I thought you’d understand. This is a necessary evil. But sure, fine, {wi}I wouldn’t ever push you to do anything you don’t want to do.{wc}Consider your contract terminated."
SAY.Final.191.,,"{i}She walks by me like she’s going to open the door for me. {wi}I let go of a breath I didn’t know I was holding.{wc}And then in a flash of silver, I go into shock for the second time that night."
SAY.Final.199.,,"{i}My throat.{wc}I try to speak, to scream, but the signature smell and flow of blood choke up my mouth. {wi}It’s painful. It’s so painful. I’m drowning.{wc}Miss, it hurts, Miss -- but oh, I guess that’s not your real name, is it? {wi}How could you do this?{wi} What did I do? {wc}I can’t believe I ever trusted you. I thought we had something. But now I’ll die hating you."
SAY.Final.202.,,"{i}...And you say something but I don’t register it.{wc}Whatever you say can’t do anything. Sorry can’t fix this, even an “I love you” can’t.{wc}It hurts, it hurts, it HURTS. {s=60}This pain this fear this loss this blood this agony these tears --"
SAY.Final.203.,,"{i}{s=60}I can’t breathe, I can’t think, my mind, my nerves, I hope I die soon, I hope it ends soon.{/s}{wc}Is this what you did to that poor guy on the floor? What do you mean then, ‘necessary evil’? {wc}No one should go through this. {wi}Except you."
SAY.Final.204.,,"{i}Broken, you’re broken, and now I am too, and{s=60} I’m on the floor bleeding out and drowning and it hurts so much and I wish it would stop and I hate you yet in my final moments all I think of is an illusion of you."
SAY.Final.307.Miss,,"...{wc}...2 minutes and 13 seconds.{wc}I’m so sorry, my dear, I tried to aim for the back.{wc}A life exchanged for another, an innocent soul I tainted traded for one of a vile being. An eye for an eye -- or, I guess a life -- and now my heart for a neck.{wc}What will happen next time? Can I keep going like this? For people who don’t even give me a second glance unless I’m giving them all I have?"
SAY.Final.213.Miss,,"...But it’s worth it in the end. {wi}It has to be. I can’t stop now, it can’t all have been for nothing.{wc}This never-ending game of thoughts and words and morals, the screams of corruption and the grayness of fixing it, someone needs to be the Robin Hood in this life even if it breaks me."
SAY.Final.214.Miss,,"I was so jealous of you, Ellie, of being able to live in an illusion of a fixable world.{wc}Let me live like that too.{wc}She took my eye and you took my heart, so let me take that illusion from you.{wc}Let me breathe air that no longer suffocates me, let me believe these sacrifices are not in vain."
SAY.Final.215.Miss,,{s=15}...{/s}
SAY.Final.216.Miss,,"I can only keep going on. Perhaps it’s time to find someone new, just one last time. {wi}I will miss you dearly, Ellie."
SAY.Final.222.Ellie,,...Let’s partner up.
SAY.Final.223.Miss,,"Oh!{wc}You mean like, going to buying replacement TVs together or something? No worries, I didn’t break any TVs this time."
SAY.Final.224.Ellie,,"No, no, like... like killing..."
SAY.Final.225.Miss,,...Do you want to help with that?
SAY.Final.226.Ellie,,...
SAY.Final.233.Ellie,,"Yeah. You’re right, someone needs to help fix this world, however messed up that definition of ‘fix’ might be."
SAY.Final.228.,,{i}Miss's expression softens.
SAY.Final.229.Miss,,"..Really? That’s the first time...{wc}You understand then, right? The demise when one is sentenced for the murder of a murderer, the dread when the rape of a child equals a month of community service simply because of the type of lawyer money can bring."
SAY.Final.230.Miss,,"But I’ve been corrupted by all this death and all these feelings.{wc}When I first took you on, I wondered if I should let you stay innocent forever. But my jealousy got the better of me, with purposely not cleaning up traces of blood and doing things in plain sight of you.{wc}So I’m sorry about that, Ellie. But I’m even more sorry for the things you’ll end up witnessing, your inevitable complete loss of innocence."
SAY.Final.234.Ellie,,"...{wc}...It’s okay, I want to help.{wi} I want to stay with you."
SAY.Final.235.Miss,,"Well then, if that’s the case, let us end as many corrupted souls as we can. We’ll become the Robin Hoods of this world together, yeah?"
SAY.Final.236.Ellie,,Okay...!
SAY.Final.240.Ellie,,Do I even have a choice?
SAY.Final.241.Miss,,"What do you mean? Of course you do!{wc}I wouldn’t ever push you to do anything you don’t want to do. Not even in a different timeline, had you said something else."
SAY.Final.242.Ellie,,"..No, sorry -- I mean, it’s okay, I’ll do it. I’ll help you clean."
SAY.Final.243.Miss,,"That’s my Ellie!{wc}See, even in a world of corrupted social hierarchies and people and governments, I can always depend on you.{wc}Come on, you’re cleaning up this manor today."
SAY.Final.245.Miss,,Let’s make today a good one!
