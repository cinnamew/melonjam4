SAY.ENIntro.4.Ellie,,...
SAY.ENIntro.5.Ellie,,"Hmm... there’s not really much else to say, I’m just a normal girl with normal hobbies and a normal-ish job...{wc}Um, wanna know my favorite color? It's #c70a0a, a nice shade between red and red velvet!"
SAY.ENIntro.105.Ellie,,"I don’t know, I’m just rambling on now..."
SAY.ENIntro.7.Ellie,,"Oh! Today marks the 3 week anniversary of my first ever job. It doesn’t have any set hours, but it pays $1,500 every time I go! Can you believe it?"
SAY.ENIntro.6.Ellie,,"Ah, but you must be wondering ‘where are you?’ and ‘what are you wearing?’ and ‘why does your hair look so gorgeous?’.{wi} Fear not, for I am here to answer all your questions!"
SAY.ENIntro.23.Ellie,,My first college semester is finally over!! All my pain and suffering can end!!!
SAY.ENIntro.109.Ellie,,"Temporarily, but still..."
SAY.ENIntro.25.Ellie,,"Woah, what is this? A poster? It’s so cute!"
SAY.ENIntro.26.Ellie,,Hmmm..{wc}Miss Inconspicuous Maid Girl Cleaning Co... (That’s such a long name)... Now hiring for --
SAY.ENIntro.113.Ellie,, -- HUH?
SAY.ENIntro.115.Ellie,,"$1,500 per day on the job?{wi} IN THIS ECONOMY!? And a day on the job meaning ... an HOUR?"
SAY.ENIntro.102.Ellie,,"Oh my gosh, should I just join?"

SAY.ENIntro.30.,,Are you sure?
MENU.ENIntro.202,,Yes (why...)
MENU.ENIntro.203,,No (good choice)
SAY.ENIntro.37.Ellie,,"Alright, I’m in!"
SAY.ENIntro.118.Ellie,,"Oh, it seems the company’s building is supposed to be... the one in front of me?"
SAY.ENIntro.120.Ellie,,Let’s go!
SAY.ENIntro.40.Ellie,,"Woah... wait.. hold on, what’s going on?!?!"
SAY.ENIntro.205.,,"Okay, if you insist..."
SAY.ENIntro.33.,,"And thus Ellie the normal girl with normal hobbies continued on with her normal day in her normal life in this normal, non-corrupted, world."
SAY.ENIntro.70.Ellie,,Today is my 3-week job anniversary with Miss!
SAY.ENIntro.103.Ellie,,"Honestly, she was pretty terrible at explaining what the job actually entails...{wc}I know it all sounds so suspicious -- I didn’t even believe it at first, until I cashed in my first paycheck -- but I love seeing the money in my bank account!!"
SAY.ENIntro.134.Ellie,,"It’s just tough discovering things about the job I should've been told about, like how atrocious the hours really are.{wc}I said something about it, but Miss told me that I should’ve read the contract -- I know, but how could anyone possibly read such a boringly long thing??"
SAY.ENIntro.136.Ellie,,"Anyways, the only shift starts at 2 AM, and I get notice a day or two beforehand if I'm lucky. If I'm not, I get the notice the day of!{wc}Sometimes my shifts are even canceled just hours before. "
SAY.ENIntro.138.Ellie,,"R.I.P my sleep schedule, but anything for the money, I guess...!{"
SAY.ENIntro.141.Ellie,,"It's currently 5 PM. I've got 9 more hours before my job today starts.{wc}Gaaaah, this day is going to be soooo long."
SAY.ENIntro.83.Ellie,,"Alright, it’s 12 AM and Miss just confirmed that we have work today! Time to get ready!{wc}Huh? Do I like my job?"
SAY.ENIntro.142.Ellie,,"Well, I mean... the maid costume is cute! It’s my favorite part of this work. So yeah, I guess I do like it!"
SAY.ENIntro.145.Ellie,,"It just seems a little dangerous sometimes, but Miss takes care of me really well. She’s so mature even though she’s my age. I’m really grateful for her!"
SAY.ENIntro.88.Ellie,,"{i}I walk into Pocket Jewelry Shop.{wc}Unlike what the name might suggest, it’s actually a very high-end brand that apparently only sells the most high-quality jewelry.{wc}I'd like to buy some one day.{wc}Pocket Jewelry, definitely not meant to be carried in your pocket or paid with pocket money.{/i}"
SAY.ENIntro.92.Miss,,"Hey there, Ellie! How are you?"
SAY.ENIntro.95.Ellie,,I’m doing great! How about you?
SAY.ENIntro.146.Miss,,"Good to hear, I’m well too!{wc}As you can probably tell, we’re cleaning up after a jewelry shop robbery today."
SAY.ENIntro.97.Miss,,Someone broke the windows and all the cases; I’ll be fixing a few small things around the area and you can cover the more prominent issues.
SAY.ENIntro.149.Miss,,Let’s make it a good one!
SAY.ENIntro.99.Ellie,,"{i}(Ah, I forgot to tell you the second most important part of the job -- the first being our maid dresses, of course!)"
SAY.ENIntro.151.Ellie,,"{i}(We’re actually cleaning up top secret crime scenes!){wc}(I know, it shocked me at first, too!!!)"
SAY.ENIntro.153.Ellie,,"{i}(Well, I say we clean up “crime scenes,” but I’ve only done robberies that involve broken glass so far. I guess Miss is only confident in my glass repairing skills.)"
SAY.ENIntro.157.Ellie,,What -- what am I wearing??{wc}Wow... I actually look really cute in this costume.{wc}Who knew wearing so many ruffles could fit me so well?
SAY.ENIntro.159.???,,"Hello, dear!"
SAY.ENIntro.161.Ellie,,WAAAH!{wc}What the melon?? {wi}...Who are you?
SAY.ENIntro.163.???,,..? {wi}You walked into my company and you’re asking who I am?
SAY.ENIntro.165.Ellie,,"OH!! {w=0.5}Oh, I’m so sorry! I didn’t realize! I got distracted by-- uh, my dress, like..."
SAY.ENIntro.167.???,,"Hahaha, you’re an adorable one.{wc}Did you come here because you were interested in our job listing?"
SAY.ENIntro.169.Ellie,,Ummmm... I guess??
SAY.ENIntro.171.Ellie,,"Truthfully, I came in here to ask about that, but I have no idea how I got in this dress, I swear it was some magical girl type of thing... {wc}I don’t know, I probably sound really crazy right now, but I seriously am so confused!"
SAY.ENIntro.172.???,,"Haha, that sounds like a weird occurrence."
SAY.ENIntro.173.Ellie,,{i}(She doesn’t believe me...){/i}
SAY.ENIntro.174.???,,"Here, as you might have known already, we are currently hiring at the moment and we start at $1,500 per job.{wc}Jobs usually takes an hour, though our working hours aren’t the most stable or convenient.{wc}Tell you what, I’ve taken a liking to you. All you need to do is fill out this contract and you’re all set to go!"
SAY.ENIntro.176.Ellie,,"Ahhh, $1,500 an hour sounds like a godsend!! It’s too good to be true! I guess the unstable hours are the tradeoff."
SAY.ENIntro.178.Ellie,,"But waitwaitwait, I don’t even know much about this job!{wc}As far as I’m aware, we work as maids, but that doesn’t tell me anything! What do we even do?"
SAY.ENIntro.179.???,,"Oh, we just clean up some messes people have made, and we are to usually work in different places, though you’ll probably be working with me.{wc}It is actually quite a simple job. You will only need to work on the easier tasks at first, such as picking up broken material and sweeping floors.{wc}Just make sure you don’t tell anyone about this job or what you do and know that I can’t answer all your questions. Our clients are pretty serious about staying private!"
SAY.ENIntro.181.Ellie,,"Mmmm... I think I’m pretty good at cleaning, and I don’t mind the privacy thing.."
SAY.ENIntro.183.Ellie,,"Ah! Wait! {wi}Before I sign, may I know your name?"
SAY.ENIntro.184.???,,"Hahah, you can call me Miss."
SAY.ENIntro.185.Ellie,,"...OK, Miss! I’ve made my decision! Hand over that contract, please!"
SAY.ENIntro.199.,,Are you really really sure?
